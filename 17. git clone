git clone:

- clones the project into our system.
- if we do some changes on the cloned project that is on our system now, and we want to to push
    the updated project in our own remote repository, first we need to remove the origin and then add
    our own origin.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    cmd:
        1) cloning the project from remote repository.
            
            git clone project/repository_link

        2) removing the remote origin.

            git remote rm origin

        3) Now we can add our own origin / remote repo link and do push.

            git remote add origin repository_link
