suppose you have a 2 branches; main branch and bugfix/spider branch.
cmd:
    i) first checkout to bugfix/spider branch.

        git checkout bugfix/spider
    
    ii) rebase main branch.

        git rebase main
        - applies the changes from main branch to the bugfix/spider branch
        - although the branch appears the same, it's made up of entirely new commits.

    iii) checkout to main branch.

        git checkout main

    iv) rebase gugfix/spider branch.

        git rebase bugfix/spider
        - applies the changes from bugfix/spider branch to the main branch.

    v) now you can delete the bugfix/spider branch if you want to.
