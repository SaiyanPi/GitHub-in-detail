---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cmd:
    i) create and switch to a new branch page/menu.

        git branch page/menu
        git checkout page/menu

    ii) make changes and create new commits in a new branch page/menu.

        a) commits for adding new page 'menu'.

            git commit -m "menu page added"

        b) commits for updating menu page.

            git commit -m "updated menu"
    
    iii) switch back to main branch.

        git checkout main

    iv) make changes and create a new commit(s) in a main branch.

        a) commit for updating index page.

            git commit -m "updated index for menu"
    
    at this point,
    - we 've 2 branches; main and page/menu
    - we've pushed the newly added and updated menu page in 'page/menu' branch in the online repository
      with 2 commits.
    - we've also pushed the update on index page in the main branch with 1 commit. 

    things that needs to be noticed,
    - 2 commits we did in the page/menu branch are not visible from the main branch or in another word,
      changes we made in page/menu branch cannot be seen in main branch.
      but once we merge the page/menu branch into the main branch, all changes done in page/menu branch
      will be visible in the main branch.
    - similarly, changes we made back in main branch cannot be seen in the page/menu branch.
      So, what if we want to apply the changes from main branch to new branch page/menu.
      This is where the 'git pull origin main' comes in.

    v) pull changes from main branch to branch page/menu.

        a) first switch to a page/menu branch.

            git checkout page/menu

        b) pull the changes from main to a page/menu.
            
            git pull origin main

    vi) finally merge the page/menu to a main branch

        a) first checkout to main branch.
            
            git checkout main
        
        b) merge.

            git merge page/menu
