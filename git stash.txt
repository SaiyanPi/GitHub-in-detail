git stash:

- to save something for temporary purpose.
- can undo(back to recent commit) the changes made in already created file.
- but cannot undo the file creation with stash.
- we can only stash the changes in file that are in working directory and staging area
- once we commit the changes hence pushing the file in local repository, we cannot stash the changes.
