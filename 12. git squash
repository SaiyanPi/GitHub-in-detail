git squash:

- squash/combine a multiple commits to single commit.
  git rebase (--continue | --abort | --skip)

- let's say we have a 'git log --oneline' as:
    
            591d895 (HEAD -> main, origin/main) title - mouse
            e0e79d3 title - keyboard
            3c9a5df paragraph - keyboard
            8ad0a3d paragraph - mouse
            83bc386 added mouse and keyboard

    -> we want to combine the first 4 commits to a '83bc386 added mouse and keyboard' commit

    1) git rebase -i HEAD~5

        o/p: 
            591d895 (HEAD -> main, origin/main) title - mouse
            pick 83bc386 added mouse and keyboard
            pick 8ad0a3d paragraph - mouse
            pick 3c9a5df paragraph - keyboard
            pick e0e79d3 title - keyboard
            pick 591d895 title - mouse

    2) change the keyword 'pick' of the commitsthat we want to squash into 'squash' 

        591d895 (HEAD -> main, origin/main) title - mouse
        pick 83bc386 added mouse and keyboard
        squash 8ad0a3d paragraph - mouse
        squash 3c9a5df paragraph - keyboard
        squash e0e79d3 title - keyboard
        squash 591d895 title - mouse

    3) Click ESC, ENTER, :, x, and ENTER

        591d895 (HEAD -> main, origin/main) title - mouse
        pick 83bc386 added mouse and keyboard
        # This is a combination of 5 commits.
        # This is the 1st commit message:

        added mouse and keyboard

        # This is the commit message #2:

        paragraph - mouse

        # This is the commit message #3:

        paragraph - keyboard

        # This is the commit message #4:

        title - keyboard

        # This is the commit message #5:

        title - mouse

    4) again Click ESC, ENTER, :, x, and ENTER to exit

    5) now we should be back on a normal terminal and if we 'git log --oneline'
