git revert:

- reverts the commit.
- it doesn't remove the commit but reverts the changes done on the particular commit but 
  while doing so it creates a new commit.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

let's say we have a 'git log --oneline' as follows and we want to revert the 'button added' commit:
    
    437eede (HEAD -> revert, origin/revert) button added        (HEAD 0)
    2606b1f updated menu                                        (HEAD 1)
    c4d0846 added home and menu                                 (HEAD 2)

then, 
cmd: git revert HEAD~0

- now changes related to the commit 'button added' will be gone and the new log will be
    
    5633135 (HEAD -> revert) Revert "button added"
    437eede (origin/revert) button added
    2606b1f updated menu
    c4d0846 added home and menu
