rebase conflict:

- similar to merge conflict except we get the conflict error while rebasing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

solving rebase conflict:

- since we edit the same line of code of the same file from 2 different branches, to solve
    rebase conflict, we have to apply only one changes; either changes from the main branch or another
    branch. 

    fa52e28 - updated index from main branch
    e163f1e - updated index from cow branch    
    ec7dc05 - added cow page
    ab6e27d 

    if we do 'git merge main' from cow branch, we will get a rebase merge conflict error. to solve it,
    we either have to keep commit e163f1e(incoming changes) or fa52e28(current changes) to solve the
    rebase conflict. let's assume we've decided to keep the current changes/changes from main branch
    and discard incoming changes/changes from cow branch.

- now if we do 'git status' then index.html file would be modified so we need

    cmd: git add . / git add index.html

    cmd: git commit -m "rebase conflict index"

       - terminal output:   interactive rebase in progress; onto 
                            Last commands done (2 commands done):
                            pick ec7dc05 added cow page
                            pick e163f1e updated index from cow branch
                            No commands remaining.
                            You are currently rebasing branch 'page/cow' on 'fa52e28'.
                            (all conflicts fixed: run "git rebase --continue")
    
    cmd: git rebase --continue

- finally the rebase is done. now, we can switch to main branch and rebase the cow branch.
