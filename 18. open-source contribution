open-source contribution:

- steps:
    1) fork
    2) clone the repo into local system
    3) never work on main branch, create a new branch, checkout, work on that branch, and push on that branch
    4) send pull request
    if changes/updates you've done looks good, the owner will merge it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1) forking the repository will create a new repository in our own account.

    2) clone the repo(forked) source code into our local system.

    3) create a branch, work on it, and push on it

    4) next we want to merge the changes we've made into the original repository from which we've forked.
        for that, we need to create a pull request in company's repository.

        now, owner of original repo(some company) will see the pull request and all the changes we've made.
        if everything is okay in our changes, they can merge pull request and the changes will be applied
        to their original repository.

pull changes from original repo to forked repo in our account:

- at this point we have
    i) an original repo from some company
    ii) forked repo in our account
    iii) cloned repo source code in our local system.

    now, the original repo will have other changes from other contributers or company and how to pull
    those changes into our forked repo?

- steps:
    A) add a connection to a original repository
    cmd:
        
        git remote add connection_name original_repository_link
        git remote add upstream https://github.com/facebook/react.git

         -> now we've established a connection with the original repository
         -> to list all the connection: git remote
         -> at this point we have 2 connections; origin and upstream.
         -> to list connections with url: git remote -v

    B) now, we can pull from the connection.
    cmd: 

        git pull connection_name branch_name
        git pull upstream main

        -> at this point we have pulled the changes from original repo into our local system but the changes
            are not yet applied in the forked repo in our account.
        -> so obviously next, we need to push the changes 

    C) push the changes to forked repo in our account
    cmd:

        git push origin main
