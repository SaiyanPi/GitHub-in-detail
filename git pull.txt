git pull:

- you have a local system and an online repository GitHub.
  when multiple person are working on the same repository, your local file may not match with the file
  copy in an online repository. someone could have added a new file or updated the existing file in an
  online repository. In this case you cannot push your locally made changes in an online repository.

  for eg, 
    i) update and commit the index file directly in an online repository.
        note that now the file on your local machine and on the online repository are different.

    ii) unaware of this, you do some coding locally and then finally push the changes/updates in an
        online repository. when you do so, there will be an error:

            ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
            error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/SaiyanPi/GitHub'
            hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
            hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
            hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
            hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
            hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
        
        before pushing our locally made changes/updates, we need to make our local files same as the
        files in online repository. and this is where the 'git pull' comes in. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cmd:
    iii) pull changes from online repository to local files.

        git pull origin branch_name
        - git pull origin main

    iv) now we will be able to push our changes to an online repository.
